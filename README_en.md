* You need to manually bypass the possible SU detection in the game itself
* The Shamiko mod provides a way to bypass SU detection. It is up to you to decide whether to flash it in, but the official version of the magisk users recommends flashing it in.
* If the SU environment is not provided by the magisk, then by default you have a certain foundation in gaming and need to manually flash the JMBQ mod, and the rest of the problems will be solved by yourself.
* If you don't know how to use it, come here for a tutorial (the official version of the magisk users) https://mega.nz/folder/spFFgSia#dd5jeZHyADqZ5a1lEj3xgw
